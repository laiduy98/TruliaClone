            <h3>About</h3>
            <p>At V-EState, we believe that when it comes to finding a home what's outside the front door is just as
                important as what's behind it. That's why we go beyond the typical listings, by sourcing insights
                straight
                from locals and offering over 34 neighborhood map overlays, to give people a deeper understanding of
                what
                living in a home and neighborhood is really like. We're committed to helping them discover a place
                where
                they will love to live and where they will feel more connected to the community and to each other. It's
                why
                we strive every day to help build a more neighborly world.</p>
